    <div class="introduction">
    <p>This is a Software Engineering experiment that aims to identify for Open Source Software (OSS) projects, 
    documentation that is relevant for newcomers during their contribution process. In this context, a newcomer can be defined
    as any potential contributor willing to contribute with an OSS project. </p>
    <p> We have a set of seven predefined categories known to be important for new contributors, and we would like to ask
    you to find these categories for a set of OSS projects. Follow the steps defined below to participate of the experiment.</p>

    <div class="meet-the-categories">
    <p>Before identifying categories for any documentation file, it is important to carefully understand the categories we would like to identify. 
    In the following list, we describe all the seven predefined categories, including some real examples for each one of them:</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
        <b>CF – Contribution flow:</b>
        It is not uncommon for newcomers to feel lost and unmotivated when it is not clear how to contribute with an OSS project. For this category, we would like to identify documentation that describes what is the contribution flow of a project. The contribution flow can be defined as a set of steps a newcomer need to follow to develop an acceptable contribution for the project.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>CT – Choose a task:</b>
        Many developers are interested in contributing with OSS projects, but most of them don’t know what task they should start with. In this category, we would like to identify sentences describing how newcomers can find a task to contribute with the project.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>FM – Find a mentor:</b>
        In most OSS projects, mentors are assigned to help newcomers during their contribution process. For this category, we would like to identify information about how newcomers can find people in the project to act as mentors during their contribution process.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>TC – Talk to the community:</b>
        Besides having a mentor, it is also important for newcomers to get in touch with the project’ community itself. For this reason, we would like to identify any information that describes how a newcomer can get in touch with the community members, including links for communication channels, tutorials on how to send a message, communication etiquette, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>BW – Build local workspace:</b>
        Newcomers reported in previous studies that they did not find explanations about how they could build their own workspace (build, compile, execute, manage dependencies, etc.) before contributing. We would like to identify sections in documentation that defines the steps on how to build a local workspace.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>DC – Deal with the code:</b>
        Many projects have their own code standards, software architectures and practices. In this category, we would like to identify sections in documentation describing how code should be written, organized and documented.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>SC – Submit the changes:</b>
        The last step in the contribution process is the submission of  changes. In this category, we would like to identify information about how the change/patch submission should be made.
        </li>
    </ul>
    These categories were defined based on previous experiences reported by new contributors in OSS projects. Your mission in this experiment is to identify these seven categories
    for a set of OSS projects. In the following section, we explain how the identification must be done.

    </div>
    <div class="apply-categories">
    <p>Now that you have understood the categories, the second step is to identify them in documentation files. 
    For this task, we have a set of spreadsheets containing information from documentation files of real OSS projects. 
    You will select five spreadsheets from this set, create your own copy of the
    spreadsheets you have selected, and try to identify the categories for all of them. Note that the spreadsheets are divided in two pages, README and CONTRIBUTING, please do not forget to do the identification
    for both of the pages. A brief tutorial about how the identification should be done is defined as follows:</p>
    <ol type="1" class="list">
        <h5>Identification Tutorial</h5>
        <li>For each spreadsheet you have selected/copied, read carefully the paragraphs in the first column.</li>
        <img src="img/paragraphs.png" alt="Arrow pointing a paragraph in a spreadsheet" style="width: 50%;">
        <li>If you identify one or more categories in a paragraph, mark an X in the columns of the categories that you have identified, respectively.</li>
        <img src="img/columns.png" alt="Two arrows pointing X symbols for categories in a spreadsheet" style="width: 50%;">
        <li>Repeat the same steps for all the spreadsheets, and do not forget to do the identification for either of the two pages in a spreadsheet.</li>
        <img src="img/pages.png" alt="Two arrows pointing the pages of a spreadsheet" style="width: 50%;">
        <li>Submit the spreadsheets you have classified following the tutorial of the next section.</li>

        If this is your first time doing this kind of analysis, do not be afraid! Here are a few tips that may help you during this experiment:
        <ul>
            <li>
             <b>Use your perspective as newcomer:</b> There is no specific way to identify the categories. 
             If you have understood the categories correctly, feel free to interpret the paragraphs using your own perspective and apply as many categories as you believe for each of them.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>Paragraphs may not contain relevant information:</b> Some of the paragraphs may not contain relevant information for newcomers. Make sure you read the 
            paragraphs carefully, and feel free to skip the "irrelevant" ones.
            </li>       
            <li>
            <b>Restrict your analysis to the spreadsheets:</b> You do not need to open links, subscribe to mailing lists or do something similar during the analysis. Just use the 
            information given to you in the spreadsheets. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        If you have any questions, feel free to contact us by email: fronchetti@usp.br. We will answer your questions as soon as possible.

        <p>This is the final step. Save the five spreadsheets you have analyzed in a folder, compress the folder, and submit it attached
            in a email to <a href="mailto:fronchetti@usp.br"><b>fronchetti@usp.br</b></a>. If you used Google Drive to do the analysis, you can just submit the spreadsheets links to the same email 
            (Do not forget to enable the permission to visualize the spreadsheets you have shared). Feel free to also share your opinions around this experiment in the email.
